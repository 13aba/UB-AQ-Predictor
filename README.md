#  Air Quality Forecasting with Machine Learning

This project uses 10 years of daily air quality data to predict pollutant levels such as PM2.5, PM10, and COâ‚‚ using deep learning and time series models. It combines environmental data with population to build interpretable forecasts of future air quality.
